      ### **CPI COIN**


      The CPI coin is essentially a governance token, which is used to represent an interest in the health of the CPIX token ecosystem. 


      In this way, the CPI token will be the core unit of the CPI ecosystem, as it’s directly used to access our products and services, and is in no way an investment by itself.


      CPI token holders will be able to reward or penalise participants in the CPI network. CPI holders are incentivised to participate in the governance of the ecosystem through coin burns.

      ### **THE CPIX TOKENS**


      CPIX tokens are backed by component assets, held via an escrow smart contract. In order to mint the genesis CPIX tokens, a portion of the CPI funds will be deposited to the CPIX smart contract.


      Users can mint CPIX Tokens by depositing cryptocurrency, such as ETH or wrapped BTC. In order to redeem tokens, users can redeposit their CPIX back to the smart contract, simultaneously receiving ETH and burning the CPIX specific to that contract, e.g. CPI30.  As we’ve discussed, the token will then self balance.


      The CPI token will bestow governance powers to its token holders. These include voting on which assets will be included in the CPIX  asset list, and steering the CPIX token’s direction.
