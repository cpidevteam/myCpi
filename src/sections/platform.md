Our platform is comprised of four key elements â€“ data points, our API service, the CPI Blockchain, and finally, exchanges. Data point services collect real-time data from exchanges which CPI connects to. The CPI platform will then calculate the average crypto price index, providing prices via an API.

Price history will be stored on our proprietary CPI blockchain, where it will be transparent and auditable. Finally, holders of the CPI coin will be given access to our API service.
